         and projects that I felt were worthwhile to share on the internet. Check it out and let me know what you think!`

        title: 'Now Playing Page is Online!',
        content: `In anticipation of the 2018 New York Marathon, I wanted to create a fun app/project to
         share my experience with everyone, especially those who generously gave to LLS! I came up with the idea to share
         my music, and created a mini app using Spotify's developer APIs. Check it out now on the
         <a href="/#/nowPlaying">Now Playing</a> tab! When I'm using spotify, the app
         displays the song I am currently listening to and provides links to listen along.
         For a small subset of songs you'll also see my thoughts, namely all songs on my
         <a href=https://open.spotify.com/user/12137830555/playlist/2JUf2gUEcVwxOue6vaASwa?si=fJzXY5RQRua6JmYtVmXZfQ>
         "GAL 26.2"</a> marathon playlist. Listen along! (Spoiler alert, the point of this page is to get more eyes on LLS
         and potentially race more donations during the race!)`

        title: 'Groovin Against Leukemia',
        content: `In November 2017, I watched the New York Marathon and loved it. The scale of the race is incredible
         and I've always toyed around with doing one to prove I could. 6 months, 300+ miles,
         and $35,000+ in fundraising later and I'm well on my way!
         I started <em>Groovin Against Leukemia</em> back in March 2018 with a few friends, and since then
         we've crushed our training and raised more than we thought possible for the Leukemia Lymphoma Society.
         The whole process has been incredible, and I've been
         <a href="">documenting it all</a> if you want to read more or donate!!`

        title: 'IBM Blockchain Project: State Of Delaware',
        content: `Since starting with IBM Blockchain a year ago, my project for the State of Delaware is
         the first one I can publicly write about.
         Thanks to the freedom of information act, you can read a brief writeup on our project
         <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y7ogmqxs">here</a>.
         Over the past few months we've built a blockchain network for the State of Delaware
         to enable Delaware incorporated companies (over 50% of companies in the US)
         to easily track the authorization and issuance of their stock amongst shareholders, law firms, and
         registered agents. Delaware is looking to maintain it's innovative reputation and become the first
         blockchain-enabled state!`

        content: `In September 2017, I began my first post-graduation job working for IBM Blockchain as a consultant
         and software developer! Since joining I've had the opportunity to build blockchain applications across
         multiple industries including supply chain, healthcare, finance, insurance, and government. I can't go into
         specifics, but we leverage <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a>,
         an open source private blockchain framework backed by the Linux Foundation,
         to build our networks.`

         cross country road trip, loads of resources from our build, and hundreds of pictures (thousands if you include
            <a href="http://www.beargoldstein.com/">Bear Goldstien's Photos</a>).

        title: 'Tiger Bed Rentals',
        content: `Adam Hardej and I started our first business, Tiger Bed Rentals LLC, in the Summer of 2016. Our business
         offered full XL mattresses rentals
         to college students at low prices and handled move-in, move-out, and summer storage. We thrived under the motto
         "You rent. You sleep. We do the rest." After
         we graduated from college, Adam took the reigns of the business and eventually sold it Roommie Rentals
         in the fall of 2018. Check out the <a href="tigerbedrentals.com">website for TBR</a>
         (which I assume is still operational) and a write up on Tiger Beds from

        title: 'Impact: The Environmental Calculator Application',
        content: `In the fall of 2015, I completed my Princeton indepentent work in a seminar called "Applications for the Environment."
         Over the course of the semester, I built an andriod application to track a user's environmental impact in terms of
         carbon footprint and water usage across five activities: food consumption, direct water use, trash production, energy use,
         and transportation. The application included daily and weekly leaderboards based on location, and overall allowed users to
         comprehend their environmental impact and incentivize them to decrease it relative to those around them. After
         completion of my application and adoption
         from 20+ students on campus, I was awarded Princeton's 25 Under 25 Award given to the 25 students under the age of 25 with the
         most innovative independent projects. `
