        content: `In ancicipation of the 2018 New York Marathon, I wanted to create a fun app/tool/project to
         share my experience with everyone else, especially those who generously gave! I came up with the idea to share
         my music, and created a mini app using Spotify's developer APIs. Check it out now on the now playing tab! The app
         wil display the song I am currently listening to, provide links if you would like to listen along.
         For a few songs I've also written what goes through my head when it comes on, namely all songs on my

        title: 'Groovin Against Leukemia',
        content: `In November 2017, I watched the New York Marathon and loved it. The scale of the race is incredible,
         it's inspiring, and I've always toyed around with doing one just to prove I could. 6 months, 300+ miles, and $35,000+ later
         and I am well on my way!

         I started <em>Groovin Against Leukemia</em> with a few friends and we've crushed our training and raised more than we thought
         possible for the Leukemai Lymphoma Society. The whole process has been incredible, and I've been
         <a href="">documenting it all</a> if you want to read more or donate!!`

        title: 'IBM Blockchain: State Of Delaware',
        content: `Since starting with IBM in the fall of 2017, the first project I can comfortably write about on the internet is
         my project for the State of Delaware. Thanks to the freedom of information act, you can read about the project
         <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y7ogmqxs">here</a>. The project stems from an issue Dole ran into when tracking down its
         shareholders in a class action law suit a few years ago (<a href="https://tinyurl.com/yamfptd9">solid article</a>).
         We are aiming to build a blockchain system for Delaware, where upwards of %50 of US companies are incorporated,
         to track the authorization and issuance of stock between multiple corporations, shareholders, law firms, and
         registered agents. Delware is looking to become the first "Blockchain" state!`

        content: `I could write a whole blog on the Reller, and someday I will. I have somewhat detailed notes from every day of our
         cross country road trip, loads of resources from our build, and hundreds of pictures (thousands if you include
            <a href="http://www.beargoldstein.com/">Bear Goldstien's Photos</a>).
         For now just check out some pictures and videos of the legendary

        content: `Adam Hardej and I started our first business, Tiger Bed Rentals LLC, in the Summer of 2016. We offered full XL mattresses
         to college students at low prices and handled all move-in, move-out, and storage. "You rent. You sleep. We do the rest." After
         we graduated from college, Adam took reigns of the business, which he eventually sold to Roommie Rents
         in the fall of 2018. Check out the <a href="tigerbedrentals.com">website for TBR</a>
