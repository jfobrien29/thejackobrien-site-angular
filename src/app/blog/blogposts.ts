        content: `In ancicipation of the 2018 New York Marathon, I wanted to create a fun app/project to
         share my experience with everyone, especially those who generously gave to LLS! I came up with the idea to share
         my music, and created a mini app using Spotify's developer APIs. Check it out now on the
         <a href="nowPlaying">Now Playing</a> tab! When I'm using spotify, the app
         displays the song I am currently listening to and provides links to listen along.
         For a small subset of songs you'll also see my thoughts, namely all songs on my
         <a href=https://open.spotify.com/user/12137830555/playlist/2JUf2gUEcVwxOue6vaASwa?si=fJzXY5RQRua6JmYtVmXZfQ>

        content: `In November 2017, I watched the New York Marathon and loved it. The scale of the race is incredible
         and I've always toyed around with doing one to prove I could. 6 months, 300+ miles,
         and $35,000+ in fundraising later and I'm well on my way!
         I started <em>Groovin Against Leukemia</em> back in March 2018 with a few friends, and since then
         we've crushed our training and raised more than we thought possible for the Leukemia Lymphoma Society.
         The whole process has been incredible, and I've been
         <a href="">documenting it all</a> if you want to read more or donate!!`

        title: 'IBM Blockchain Project: State Of Delaware',
        content: `Since starting with IBM Blockchain a year ago, my the State of Delaware project is
         the first one I can publicly discuss. 
         Thanks to the freedom of information act, you can read about the project
         <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y7ogmqxs">here</a>. The project stems from an issue Dole (yes, the fruit company)
         ran into when tracking down its
         shareholders in a class action law suit a few years back (<a href="https://tinyurl.com/yamfptd9">NY Times Read</a>).
         Over the past few months we've built a blockchain network for Delaware
         to track the authorization and issuance of stock between corporations, shareholders, law firms, and
         registered agents. Delware is looking to become the first blockchain-enabled state!`

        content: `Adam Hardej and I started our first business, Tiger Bed Rentals LLC, in the Summer of 2016. Our business
         offered full XL mattresses rentals
         to college students at low prices and handled move-in, move-out, and summer storage. We thrived under the motto
         "You rent. You sleep. We do the rest." After
         we graduated from college, Adam took the reigns of the business and eventually sold it Roommie Rentals
         in the fall of 2018. Check out the <a href="tigerbedrentals.com">website for TBR</a>
